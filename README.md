lightblue-audit-hook
====================

Audit hook for lightblue.

Written as a separate repository instead of as part of the core lightblue code.  Other hook implementations should be written separate from lightblue core so this is the example of how to do it.  Documentation can be found in the [User Guide](http://jewzaam.gitbooks.io/lightblue-user-guide/) right now.
